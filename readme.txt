Convert the event content submitted through Community Events to block editor format.

== Description ==

The extension will attempt to convert the event content submitted through Community Events to block editor format.

== Important ==

Note, this extension is still under development and NO ACTIVE SUPPORT is provided for it.
If you would like to report a bug or a request, you can do it in the [Issues](https://github.com/mt-support/tec-labs-ce-convert-content-to-blocks/issues) section in the GitHub repository.

== Requirements ==

The following two settings are required to be enabled for the extension to work.

* Events > Settings > General > Activate Block Editor for Events
* Events > Settings > Community > Use visual editor for event descriptions

If these settings are not enabled, the extension will not function.

The plugin will attempt the conversion for newly submitted events.
It will not work for events submitted in the past.

== Installation ==

Install and activate like any other plugin!

* You can upload the plugin zip file via the *Plugins â€£ Add New* screen
* You can unzip the plugin and then upload to your plugin directory (typically _wp-content/plugins_) via FTP
* Once it has been installed or uploaded, simply visit the main plugin list and activate it
